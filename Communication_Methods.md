# 🧾 Communication Methods in Modern Applications (Java + Cloud Context)

---

## 🔹 1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

### 🧠 Concept:

* HTTP-based
* Text-based (usually JSON or XML)
* Stateless, resource-oriented
* Wide support in all languages & tools

### ✅ When to Use:

* Public APIs
* Mobile & Web apps
* Simple CRUD operations

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Online Banking App**
> The mobile app sends:
> `GET /accounts/1234/transactions`
> → Receives a list of JSON-formatted transactions.

---

## 🔹 2. **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**

### 🧠 Concept:

* RPC framework using **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)**
* High performance via HTTP/2
* Strong typing
* Streaming support (unlike REST)

### ✅ When to Use:

* Internal microservices
* High-speed communication
* Streaming data scenarios

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Insurance Quote Engine**
> The frontend sends customer info to `QuoteService.GetQuote`
> → Server computes and returns a premium instantly.

---

## 🔹 3. **gRPC Streaming Types**

| Type                 | Description                                | Real Example               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Unary                | Single request → single response           | `GetQuote()`               |
| **Server Streaming** | Client sends 1 → Server streams many       | Stock price feed           |
| **Client Streaming** | Client streams many → Server responds once | File upload                |
| **Bidirectional**    | Both stream at the same time               | Real-time multiplayer game |

---

## 🔹 4. **gRPC-Web**

### 🧠 Concept:

* A bridge that allows gRPC to work in **web browsers**
* Browsers can’t handle gRPC natively (due to HTTP/2 trailers)

### ✅ When to Use:

* Frontend dashboards needing real-time data
* SPA (React/Angular) apps with internal gRPC backend

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Admin Dashboard for Mutual Funds**
> The browser uses `gRPC-Web` to subscribe to a `PortfolioService.StreamPrices()` method and receives real-time fund NAV updates.

---

## 🔹 5. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

### 🧠 Concept:

* XML-based
* Strict schema (WSDL)
* WS-\* security standards
* Common in legacy/enterprise systems

### ✅ When to Use:

* You’re integrating with **government**, **banking**, or **legacy vendors**

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Insurance Claims Integration**
> Your Java app connects to a SOAP API:
> `GetClaimDetails(policyNumber)` → XML response from the legacy system.

---

## 🔹 6. **GraphQL**

### 🧠 Concept:

* Query language for APIs
* Clients ask for exactly the data they need
* Resolves over HTTP (usually POST)

### ✅ When to Use:

* Mobile/web clients with dynamic data needs
* Avoiding over-fetching/under-fetching

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Wealth Management App**
> App queries:
>
> ```graphql
> {
>   user {
>     name
>     investments {
>       fundName
>       nav
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

---

## 🔹 7. **WebSockets**

### 🧠 Concept:

* Persistent full-duplex connection between client & server
* Real-time communication

### ✅ When to Use:

* Chats
* Games
* Collaborative tools

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Live Customer Support**
> Chat system opens WebSocket:
> → Both sides send/receive messages without reloading or polling.

---

## 🔹 8. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

### 🧠 Concept:

* One-way streaming: **server → browser**
* Over plain HTTP
* Lightweight and easy to use

### ✅ When to Use:

* Real-time notifications
* Live logs/feeds

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Monitoring Dashboard**
> Server pushes new logs via SSE to browser:
> `Event: logUpdate` → auto-displays in frontend.

---

## 🔹 9. **Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe Messaging)**

### 🧠 Concept:

* Event-based messaging
* Asynchronous & decoupled
* Publisher doesn't care who reads

### Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Google Pub/Sub

### ✅ When to Use:

* Event-driven architecture
* Scalable async workflows
* Audit/event tracking

### 💡 Real-World Example:

> **Policy Issuance Event**
> When a new insurance policy is issued:
> `PolicyIssued` event is published →
> Subscribers like email service, analytics, fraud detection all react separately.
